# Naturalist Soundscape

## Introduction

Anne Dillard's "Teaching a Stone to Talk" says the following:

> "You do not have to sit outside in the dark. If, however, you want to look at the stars, you will find that darkness is necessary. But the stars neither require nor demand it."

Up until recently, I got into a tramping accident resulting in a lower spine fracture injury. This meant a journey of moments - one where the things I loved enjoying, doing and being, and who I am as an extension, rapidly changed and slowed down.

The gentle breeze, whooshing leaves, trickling waterfalls. When rock climbing, I found ever so steps conquered. When hiking, I meet views, I meet plants, I meet humans. When outdoors, I feel tranquil.

I find comfort in the bedrocks of nature. I find nature connection and somewhat of an extension of myself.

In this following season, I am worldbuilding the outdoors through musicians of nature and natural sounds indoors. Since I am mostly in my bed due to the current condition, I hope to find a little warm soft spot where nature heals and how we are largely connected through a sensory soundspace experience.

This mini R data playground was also inspired by Annie Dillard, Henry David Thoreau, and some [MƒÅori's connection to nature](https://teara.govt.nz/en/kaitiakitanga-guardianship-and-conservation/page-2). Learned more about working with API (specifically iTunes Apple API), web search queries, and data wrangling in R.
